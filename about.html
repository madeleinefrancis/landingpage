					Born and raised in Canada, I have moved between Edmonton, Vancouver, and Victoria throughout my life, amongst travels to many parts of the world. Going to six different schools in six years as a kid exposed me to all kinds of circumstances and personalities - both good and bad <br><br>

					As a lover of aesthetics, film, and psychology I find the process of acting incredibly rewarding and fascinating <br><br>

					People might describe me as strange, funny, kind, shy, hammy or intimidating, depending on our relationship. I want to continue using method acting to search for authenticity, whether through drama or comedy, and I'm excited to collaborate with artists who want the same <br><br>

					I have been training with Michelle Myerink over the past 3 years and am looking to dive into auditions. See my resume for more details on my training and skills <br><br><br><br>
